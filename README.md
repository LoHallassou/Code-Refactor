## The basic uses of web development here express the simplicity of creating a werbsite with images and crative styling put in place throught the use of the style.css file and images saved in the images folder.

## Then the core of said website is the index.html file which acts as the foundation and framework for the website. Incoporating all the necessary information to help business owners understand the valid reasons for having a website for their business.

## Everything is saved in this repository which had some code refactored to make it easily readable for anyone new or simply intrigued on good HTML semantics and the manner in which CSS works
